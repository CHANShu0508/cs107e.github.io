title: Interrupts, cont'd
readings: |
    Now we move up to the higher-level abstractions for interrupts, including a library module for managing interrupt handlers and reviewing best practices for interrupt-safe code. If time permits, I'd like to discuss design/style issues cut from C Mastery lecture.
    +   Selected code for [using interrupts](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io/tree/master/lectures/Interrupts2/handout.pdf).
    + See C Mastery entry in [full schedule](/schedule/) for readings/slides on code style.
